------------------------  
WHERE DO WE USE MONGO?
------------------------  
- We can use mongo with any backend 
- We will use the ORM called Mongoose 
    - which is the industry standard for using Node with Mongo 


------------------------  
FUNDAMENTALS OF MONGODB 
------------------------  
- Mongo allows us to have multiple internal instances of databases inside of a 
  single Mongo process
    - this allows us to work on multiple projects without having 
      to dump our data into a backup file 
    - Each database instance can then have multiple collections 
- Each collection represents a different type of resource/model
